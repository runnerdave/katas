# katas
Repo where I save my katas from http://www.codewars.com/

To build the elevator:
$ mvn clean install -Dmain.class=net.runnerdave.elevator.ElevatorRunner

## interesting katas to do:
From: https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-programs-every-programmer-should-make-at-least-once

1. Program for Tower of Hanoi (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi) solution: Output will be the number of moves required to transfer N (this N is the input) from one tower to other (This is for getting a good hang of recursion as already someone pointed out. Oh and the solution is fun to figure out as well when you do it for the first time.)
2. Build a calendar which returns day of the week if you enter any date. (This is quite fun to build when you are starting out.)
3. Build program to extract phone numbers and emails form a long text string (even better an html page) (Will provide you appreciation and power of regular expressions)
4. Study and write an implementation of:

      a. bubble sort (basic stuff)      
      c. merge sort (again gives a practical application of recursion)
5. Once you have written the codes for 4, write a program to run these two on array/lists of random numbers with array/list sizes ranging from 10 to 10^9 (take logical log 10 intervals) and plot the runtime of these cases on a graph with two lines representing each one.

6. Try implementing a simple binary search tree (Redâ€“black tree (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red%E2%80%93black_tree) is a nice one for starter ;) ) (This should be a good exercise as debugging this when things go wrong is great fun in both logical thinking and programming implementation! )

7. (Optional, later stage) Maybe also implement a graph data structure and populate it randomly (if you are feeling adventurous try making it graph of your facebook friends ;) ) and find the shortest path (Dijkstra's algorithm("http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra's_algorithm")). (Implementing a graph data structure and its related operations yourself gives a good appreciation for various language capabilities as well, apart from good )
